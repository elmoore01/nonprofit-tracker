# NONPROFIT TRACKER

Nonprofit collaborations are at an all-time high. Recent surveys reveal that 91 percent of nonprofits engage in some form of collaboration. What's missing in our communities is a fundamental understanding of why and how nonprofits collaborate, along with a site that helps nonprofit directors identify potential collaborators in their community.

To solve this issue, we introduce the **Nonprofit Trackerâ„¢**.

The Nonprofit Tracker is a hosted database of community based organizations throughout the United States that enables users to quickly search for nonprofits that offer similar services and are looking to collaborate on a variety of programs.
